- **Changed:**
  When used with a direction :n:`->` or :n:`<-`, :tacn:`apply` now accepts an open term,
  assuming its holes can be inferred during application, as was already the case for plain
  :tacn:`apply`
  (`#18946 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/18946>`_,
  fixes `#18177 <https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/18177>`_,
